This specialized camera operator is used with an AmmoCharacter physics body and can transmit direction to the controlled character and affect how the character will move.

You must setup the character name to a matching AmmoCharacter physics body for the camera to correctly attach.

When using this camera with an AmmoDebugRenderer, be sure to place the debug operator under the camera view, to correctly match the writeframe and debug rendering with your  scene graphics.
