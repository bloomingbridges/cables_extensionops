This op will allow you to output a Boolean state change (true/false) if the specified physics objects have collided together. 
You may also just input a single object name and get a result whenever the object collides with any other physics object in your scene.
Using the "Match" options you can get multiple collisions or collisions of groups (i.e. some ball collides with the southern wall).
