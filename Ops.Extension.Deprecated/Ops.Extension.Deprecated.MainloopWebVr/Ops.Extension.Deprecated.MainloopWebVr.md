Very experimental op. 
Web VR is currently not supported in chrome.
It is supported with Mozilla firefox so we recommend working in that browser when developing for VR. 
Will also work on mobile. IOS and android. Make sure to go to your view patch screen and then "open in new window" to be able to press the Vr button.
Can be combined with the screen orientation op to create mobile VR experiences.
 
NoVR Mainloop is the same as the normal mainloop.
VR Mainloop will render twice, once for each eye, check the example file that uses the the "eye" port output for a basic setup in VR.
