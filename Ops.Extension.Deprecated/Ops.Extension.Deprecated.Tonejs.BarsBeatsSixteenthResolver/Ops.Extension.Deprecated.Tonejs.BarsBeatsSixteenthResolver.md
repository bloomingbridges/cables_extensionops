This op is useful in combination with the `Transport`-op. It has a `Position (BarsBeatsSixteenth)` output port, which outputs the current position on the (virtual) timeline, e.g. `17:2:3`. To make use of these values, e.g. to trigger certain things on the timeline `BarsBeatsSixteenthResolver` can be used.
