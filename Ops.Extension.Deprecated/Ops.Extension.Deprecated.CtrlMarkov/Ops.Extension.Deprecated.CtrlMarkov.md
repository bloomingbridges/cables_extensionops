CtrlMarkov represents a Markov Chain where each call to `next` will move to the next state. If the next state choice is an array, the next state is chosen randomly with even probability for all of the choices. For a weighted probability of the next choices, pass in an object with `state` and `probability` attributes. The probabilities will be normalized and then chosen. If no next options are given for the current state, the state will stay there.
Markov Chains can be used for many things, e.g. generating music or visuals.
