Post process effect that uses a depth texture as the input and lives in your Image Compose stack.

Since most of the parameters allows you to go into both positive and negative values, experiment with the parameters to get creative effects that might not be just traditional SSAO effects. 

The texture input also doesn't have to be an actual Depth Texture from the Render 2 Texture op - opening up SSAO to more purposes!
