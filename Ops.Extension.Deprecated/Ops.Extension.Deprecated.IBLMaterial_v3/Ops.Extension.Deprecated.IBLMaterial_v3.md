The IBL material op has a lot of options for applying materials to models.
Some tips : 
- Make sure your mesh uses triangles and not quads, otherwise normals may be incorrect.
- Try out the example lightmap textures which are included in the cables files for different lighting and reflection cubemap textures. It's also possible to build your own, check the example file.
- Enable Fresnel to get a metallic kind of lighting from a few points on your model.
