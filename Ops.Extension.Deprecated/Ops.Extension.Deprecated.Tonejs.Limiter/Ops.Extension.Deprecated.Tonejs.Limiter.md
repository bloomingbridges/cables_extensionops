`Limiter` will limit the loudness of an incoming signal. It is composed of a ?`Compressor` with a fast attack and release. Limiters are commonly used to safeguard against signal clipping. Unlike a compressor, limiters do not provide smooth gain reduction and almost completely prevent additional gain above the threshold.
