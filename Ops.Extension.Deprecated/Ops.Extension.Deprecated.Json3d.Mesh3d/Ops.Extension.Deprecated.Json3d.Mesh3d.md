Load simple 3D-Meshes with the `Mesh3D`-op. 
Supported formats are `obj`,.`fbx`, converted `svg` or other formats supported by [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp), which cables uses internally. When you upload your own 3D-mesh to cables it will be auto-converted to `json`, which can be used with the `Mesh3D`-op.
