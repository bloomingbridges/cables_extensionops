CircleMovement will transform objects to a position on a circular path that is defined by the OP settings, such as Radius and Segments. 

Position of the objects can be controlled by Time, for example with a Timer OP, and the rate of change of the position by the Duration value.

CircleMovement also generates X Y values that can be used independently to control other values in your OPs.
