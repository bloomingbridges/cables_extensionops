Can be used e.g. to create a `flash`-effect on the first beat of a music track. Good combination with the op Ops.Audio.BPMTap, just connect `bpm` and the `beat1` port of Ops.Audio.BPMTap to `beat`, connect `exe` and you are ready to go to `bang`. On a `bang` the out-value will be the same as `startValue` and to the end of the beat interpolate towards `endValue`. You can also use different `easing`-methods.
